title: Writing a BSc / MSc Thesis with our Group
---

Our group is always looking for students that are excited about our research program and want to prepare a thesis on a particular research topic with us. We often have a range of projects already in mind but are also interested in topics that the students bring to us on their own. 

## Potential Thesis Topics

* Searches for Beyond Standard Model Physics with ATLAS
* Higgs Physics with ATLAS
* Reinterpretation Tools for High Energy Physics
* AI methods for Fundamental Physics
* Statistical Modelling and Inference
* Distributed Computing and large-scale data science tools
* Simulation-Baesd Inference for FUndamental Physics
* AI-driven experiment design

## External Thesis Supervision

As our group specialized in methods research we sometimes also act as formal supervisors to data science-related thesis that are carried out in collaboration with other research organizations or industry. If you're thinking about such an external thesis, please get in touch explaining your data-science related topic.
