Title: Outreach
---
The science we do in our group touches on questions that scientists and non-scientists alike are curious about. What is the world made of? What holds it together, how does it all work? What is the future of science in the age of AI? We like to engage in various outreach activities to explain the work we do to the general public. If you're interested in working with us on a new format, do not hesitate to reach out
