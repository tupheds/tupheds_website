Our group has a long-standing interest in experimental high-energy particle physics research as part of the [ATLAS Collaboration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATLAS_experiment) at the [Large Hadron Collider](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_Hadron_Collider)

### Higgs Physics

After the discovery of the Higgs Boson in 2012, one of the big open questions is whether this particle *really* is the Higgs Boson that we know from the textbook. So far only a tiny fractions of the rich phenomenology has been experimentally tested. This includes for example the crucial question whether the vacuum state of the universe is really stable. A major aspect of our research here is our contribution to search whether we can produce two Higgs bosons *at the same time* in a single collision.

### Searches for Physics Beyond the Standard Model

We know that while the Standard Model of Particle Physics is one of the most successful theories physicists have created to understand nature, it is woefully incomplete. There must be a more fundamental theory that answers the open questions including the nature of dark matter, the masses of the neutrinos or the reason for the observed difference between matter and antimatter. Within  ATLAS we are deeply involved in serching for deviations from the Standard Model as well test theories that try to go beyond it.
