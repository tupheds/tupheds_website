We're happy to share that Kristian Tchiorny is starting a PhD in our group. He will be working on a project funded by the SFB1258 on the AI-driven design optimization of neutrino telescopes. In particularm, we will be developing strategies to optimize the planned P-ONE neutrino telescope. The work will be closely coordinated with Elisa Resconi's group.
