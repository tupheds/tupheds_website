The Excellence Cluster ORIGINS was approved for a second funding period! This is close to our heart, as our research group and the ORIGINS Data Science Lab is a direct outcome of the first funding period. We're now expanding the ODSL with a second co-coordinator (Daniel Grün) and an expanded team of researchers. Keep an eye out for job postings!
