Many congratulations to Dominik Voß for defending his thesis on Active Learning in Particle Physics. On of the main challenges we face is how to cope with the enormous space of physics theories beyond the Standard Model. Dominik adapted
a technique we developed a few years ago to the "phenomenological minimally symmetric standard model" (pMSSM). This required a significant scale up to 19 dimensions!
